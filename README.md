# SimpleDMRG.jl

This is a package-in-progress in which I am implementing the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group][DMRG]]
algorithm over matrix product states as explained in Schollwöck's [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491610001752][The
density-matrix renormalization group in the age of matrix product
states]]. See,
