# SimpleDMRG.jl

This is a package-in-progress in which I am implementing the [DMRG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group)
algorithm over matrix product states as explained in Schollwöck's [The
density-matrix renormalization group in the age of matrix product
states](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491610001752). See,

* Eric Jeckelmann, *Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithms*, 2008
* Ulrich Schollwöck, *The Density-Matrix Renormalization Group* 2005
